Main component that provides the complete skills management interface.

**Props:**
```typescript
interface SkillsBuilderProps {
  skills: Skill[];
  onSkillsChange: (skills: Skill[]) => void;
}
```

#### `SkillsBuilderPage.tsx`
Standalone page for testing and demonstration of the skills builder.

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Skill {
  name: string;
  category: string;
  level: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced' | 'expert';
}
```

### Integration

The skills builder is integrated into the main ResumeBuilder component and replaces the basic skills input with a comprehensive management system.

## Usage

### For Users

1. **Navigate to Skills Builder**
   - Click "Skills Builder" in the navigation menu
   - Or access via the Resume Builder → Skills section

2. **Add Skills**
   - Enter skill name in the input field
   - Select appropriate category
   - Choose proficiency level
   - Click "Add Skill" or press Enter

3. **Use Suggestions**
   - Click "Show Suggestions" to see recommended skills
   - Click on any suggested skill to add it
   - Filter suggestions by category

4. **Manage Skills**
   - Edit skill levels using the dropdown
   - Change categories as needed
   - Remove skills using the delete button
   - View skills organized by category

### For Developers

#### Adding New Skill Categories

1. Update the `skillCategories` array in `SkillsBuilder.tsx`:
```typescript
const skillCategories = [
  // ... existing categories
  { id: 'new-category', name: 'New Category', icon: '🎯' }
];
```

2. Add suggested skills for the new category:
```typescript
const suggestedSkills = {
  // ... existing categories
  'new-category': ['Skill 1', 'Skill 2', 'Skill 3']
};
```

#### Customizing Skill Levels

Modify the `skillLevels` array to change level names, colors, or add new levels:
```typescript
const skillLevels = [
  { value: 'novice', label: 'Novice', color: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800' },
  // ... other levels
];
```

## Migration

The system automatically migrates existing skills from the old format (string[]) to the new format (Skill[]) with default values:
- Category: 'technical'
- Level: 'intermediate'

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- [ ] Drag-and-drop skill reordering

### Potential Improvements

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to `/skills` to access the standalone skills builder
2. Test adding skills with different categories and levels
3. Verify skill management operations (edit, delete, reorder)
4. Check data persistence and migration

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run frontend tests
npm test

# Run specific skills builder tests
npm test -- --testNamePattern="SkillsBuilder"
```

## API Integration

The skills builder is designed to work with the existing resume API endpoints. Skills are stored as part of the resume data structure and can be:

- Saved with the resume
- Retrieved when loading a resume
- Updated independently
- Exported for external use

## Performance Considerations

- Skills are stored locally in localStorage for immediate access
- Large skill lists are efficiently rendered using virtualization (planned)
- Category filtering is optimized for quick updates
- Real-time search and filtering with debouncing

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Focus management for form interactions
- ARIA labels and descriptions

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Contributing

When contributing to the skills builder:

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Add comprehensive TypeScript types
3. Include accessibility considerations
4. Test across different browsers
5. Update documentation for new features

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Skills not saving:**
- Check localStorage permissions
- Verify data structure matches expected format
- Ensure proper error handling

**Migration issues:**
- Clear localStorage and restart
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify data format compatibility

**Performance issues:**
- Limit the number of skills displayed at once
- Implement pagination for large lists
- Optimize re-renders with React.memo

For additional support, check the main project documentation or create an issue in the repository.
